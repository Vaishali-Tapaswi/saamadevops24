Lab2 - Modify and debug pipeline 
       create Hello.py and Hello.java files in repo 
              hello.py
                     # This program prints Hello, world!
                     print('Hello, world!')
              Hello.java 
                    public class Hello
                            {
                                public static void main(String []args)
                                {
                                    System.out.println("My First Java Program ");
                                }
                            };

       Modify pipeline to include 
              python hello.py
              -> check error and messages 
       Modify image (default image for all jobs)
              add following two lines before stages on root level(default)
       	       default:
                       image: python
              observe it will run automatically as soon as file is changes, check messages, observe python code running sucessfully
       Create two build jobs 1 for python 2 for java 
       in java job -> write two lines 
                     javac Hello.java 
                     java Hello
       save -> observe errors 
       Modify image for each job (not default -> delete default configuration for image)
              buildpy-job:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
                stage: build
                image: 
                  name: python 
       and same way change for java build -> image name - openjdk:24-slim-bullseye

Lab1 - login to gitlab (+)
       create new group -> saamademo, private, only for me 
       in that group -> create new project/repository -> blank project 
              demo1 -> initialize repository with a README
              update aa.txt in demo1 repo 
       in project demo1 
          left side menu -> build -> pipelines -> new -> "Hello world" with GitLab CI
              -> commit-> it will start running pipeline
              check messages from pipeline -> check stages and messages
